[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/muschellij2/lungct.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/muschellij2/lungct)


The goal of lungct is to process Lung CT Scans.

## Installation

You can install lungct from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("muschellij2/lungct")
```


## Example Code

This is a basic example of lung segmentation:

``` r
library(lungct)
filename = "example.nii.gz"
reg = segment_lung(filename)
```

## COPDgene data usage

For the lung CT template, the [COPDgene data](http://www.copdgene.org/) was used:

"This research used data generated by the COPDGene study, which was supported by NIH grants U01HL089856 and U01HL089897. The COPDGene project is also supported by the COPD Foundation through contributions made by an Industry Advisory Board comprised of Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis, and Sunovion."
